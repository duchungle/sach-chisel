# Digital Design with Chisel

[![Book Cover](cover-small.jpg)](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.html)

This book is an introduction to digital system design using a modern hardware
construction language, Chisel.
In this book we focus on a slightly higher abstraction level to get you up to
speed to build more complex, interacting digital systems.

A compiled PDF version of the book is available at
[Digital Design with Chisel PDF](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.pdf).
Translations in Chinese and Japanese are also available
[here](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.html).

The book is available [at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/168933603X/).

In case you want to cite the book:

```
@book{chisel:book,
  title = {Digital Design with Chisel},

This book project has an accompanying repository containing
[Chisel examples](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples).

To build the Chisel book from the source you need make, latex, sbt, and Java JDK (1.8)
installed. Then you simply build with:

```
make
```

The book also contains slides for a one semester course on digital eletronics
with Chisel. The slides are [here](slides). You can see a
[lecture plan](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02139/) for a course
given at DTU and the corresponding
[lab material](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-lab).
